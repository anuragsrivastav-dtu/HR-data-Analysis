# HR data Analytics Dasboard
In my recent HR Data Analytics project, I utilized the power of data to unveil comprehensive insights into employee attendance patterns. The focal point was the creation of a dynamic Power BI dashboard, vividly illustrating key metrics like sick leave percentage and work-from-home percentages. These insights enable managers to proactively address health issues, assess remote work policy impacts, and tailor strategies for a healthy work-life balance.

User can segregate the data based upon the months, along with that a detailed information of each employee is also Tabulated elaborating the metrics for individual employee, this is very crucial if an HR professional needs individual data for fascilitating some descision. 
  
Three elaborate graphs are given, depicting present percentage, work from home percentage and sick leave percentage, and a clear trend can easily be deciphered from these graphs making it easy to draw conclusion , which are valubale input for descision making process.

 # Insights
 There were few major conclusions drawn from the Atliq Employee data which was used for analysis:  
 1) Prescence percentage was highest on monday and lowest on friday, this depicts people are more probable to take leaves on friday, majorly beacause of the following weekends. Therefore comapny should not shedule any important meeting or confrences on friday, instead it should be sheduled on monday, if possible.
 2) Sick leave percentage was significantly increasing for the month of june, this shows a high possibility of some seasonal flues in that particular area, therefore proper precautionary steps sould be taken around that time from the side of the company to ensure employees are safe, additional steps such as vaccination drive, if availaile could be done.
 3) Work from home percentage are also high on fridays, that actually is intertwined with the first point, therefore events where physcial prescenc of employees is neccessary, should not be sheduled on fridays.
 4) There was significant increase in work from home in certain months, apart from weekly variation, through further investigation it was found out that it was due to major regional festivals, therefore policies in such direction could be made, to make a more inclusive space in the office where people from all background and culture feel valued and respected. this will further help employes to boost their productivity and fasten the growth of the organisation.
